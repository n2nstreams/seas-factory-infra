Overview

The objective of this migration plan is to methodically transition our application stack toward a leaner, more maintainable architecture built on Next.js, shadcn/ui, and Supabase, while preserving the long-term flexibility needed for advanced AI-driven workflows. The current stack—though powerful—is overly complex for a solo builder at the MVP stage, introducing unnecessary operational overhead, cost, and risk. By adopting Supabase as the unified middleware (Auth, Database, Storage, Jobs) and Next.js with shadcn/ui for the frontend, we reduce moving parts, accelerate iteration, and simplify infrastructure without sacrificing scalability or multi-tenant security.

This plan follows a modular, strangler-fig approach: each component of the legacy system is replaced in isolation, behind feature flags and with full rollback paths, ensuring no broad or risky rewrites. The transition is structured around small, verifiable steps:
	•	Introduce new modules in parallel to existing ones (shadow or dual-run).
	•	Validate correctness and performance against predefined SLOs.
	•	Gradually shift traffic or data ownership to the new system.
	•	Decommission legacy components only after stability is proven.

The outcome is a streamlined stack that:
	•	Improves developer velocity by reducing boilerplate and infra management.
	•	Enhances reliability and observability with a smaller operational surface area.
	•	Preserves multi-tenant security via Row Level Security (RLS).
	•	Supports growth and future AI orchestration by keeping the database and auth layers Postgres-compatible and standards-aligned.

Ultimately, this migration is not a wholesale rebuild—it is an incremental evolution of the platform toward an MVP-friendly foundation, designed to get features in front of users faster while retaining a clear path to scale.

⸻

Global Governance (applies to all modules)

Feature flags & routing
	•	Flags: ui_shell_v2, auth_supabase, db_dual_write_<table>, storage_supabase, billing_v2, jobs_pg, emails_v2.
	•	Canary routing: route allowlisted users to /app2 or app2.<domain>. Keep legacy at /app.

Environments
	•	dev (personal), staging (pre-prod), prod (live).
	•	Every module lands in staging for at least 48h with telemetry parity checks.

Success SLOs
	•	p95 full-page latency: marketing ≤ 1.5s; app read ≤ 2.0s; write ≤ 2.5s.
	•	Error budget: < 1% 5xx on app routes; auth success ≥ 99.5%.
	•	Cost guardrails: monthly ceilings per environment with alerts at 50/80/100%.

Rollback
	•	Every change guarded by a flag. Rollback = disable flag + revert routing. No schema drops until 2–4 weeks after stable.

⸻

Module 1 — UI Shell Swap: Next.js + shadcn/ui (no logic change)

Objective
Replace only layout/navigation/theming while all data still calls your current backend.

Artifacts
	•	Navigation inventory: routes, required roles, data dependencies, entry points.
	•	Theming spec: tokens (colors, spacing, radii), dark mode rules, a11y contrast targets.
	•	Component adoption map: shadcn primitives to use (buttons, inputs, dialog, table, sheet, toast, tabs).

Interfaces/Contracts
	•	API boundary unchanged: same endpoints, same payloads, same auth cookie headers.
	•	Analytics map: current events → new client events (names, props, sampling).

Verification
	•	Visual parity checklist for top 10 routes.
	•	Lighthouse: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1 on /app2.
	•	A11y: keyboard navigation, focus rings, ARIA on dialogs/menus.

Rollback
	•	Flip ui_shell_v2 off. All users back to legacy shell instantly.

⸻

Module 2 — Authentication Migration: Supabase Auth (parallel → dual → cutover)

Objective
Introduce Supabase sessions without breaking legacy sessions.

	•	Provider matrix: Google, GitHub, email/magic link; error taxonomies and user messages.

Interfaces/Contracts
	•	Cookies: name prefixes (sb: for Supabase). No collision with legacy cookies.

Verification
	•	OAuth success ≥ 99.5% across providers.
	•	Single sign-out clears both session types within 5s.
	•	No duplicate user records during first 1k Supabase sign-ins (monitor creation vs link).

	•	Reconciliation plan: sampling strategy, row-count parity thresholds, hash checks.

Interfaces/Contracts

	•	Conflict resolution: source-of-truth = legacy until read switch. Idempotency keys for upserts.

Verification
	•	Drift < 0.1% for dual-written tables over 7 days.
	•	Golden queries (top 20 read patterns) return identical record counts and keys across DBs.
	•	RLS pen-tests: blocked cross-tenant reads/writes verified.

Verification
	•	Short jobs (A) and cron (B) maintain p95 < 10s and < 1 min drift respectively.
	•	Duplicate suppression rate ~100% for retried A jobs.
	•	No job loss during flag flips (prove with injected canary tasks).

	•	Proration math matches Stripe dashboard totals for 3 common flows (upgrade mid-cycle, downgrade, cancel at period end).
	•	Free-tier metering halts at limit with clear UX.
