Forge95 User Journey Audit (August 12, 2025)

Executive summary

Forge95’s vision is to provide a fully automated AI SaaS factory that takes a founder’s idea and delivers a production-ready SaaS product in days rather than months. The masterplan describes a 12-week build-out on Google Cloud with a hybrid multi-agent architecture. The public site promises that users can submit an idea, have AI agents build and deploy it, and then access their product through a marketplace with a subscription-based model.

During this user journey audit, I evaluated Forge95.com as a first-time visitor. The flows tested included homepage discovery, account creation, login/logout, idea submission, marketplace browsing, subscription/payment (where visible), and support. The overall experience demonstrated clear ambition and an engaging concept. However, there are multiple UX, performance, and clarity issues that could block or frustrate new users.

Critical issues

1. Account creation / login
	•	Issue: The sign-up flow is not consistently accessible from all pages. Links sometimes blend into the UI and are not visually prominent.
	•	Reproduction: From homepage → click “Start Building Now” → redirected to submit page without explicit prompt to create account first.
	•	Impact: New users may miss account creation entirely or feel disoriented when required later.

2. Submit idea flow
	•	Issue: On navigating to /submit-idea, the form loads but guidance is minimal. No clear example prompts or validations.
	•	Reproduction: Homepage → CTA → form. Submitting with incomplete fields produces generic error.
	•	Impact: Friction and confusion for users trying to engage with the factory’s core promise.

3. Marketplace navigation
	•	Issue: The marketplace link and content are not clearly discoverable from the main menu. Layout feels placeholder.
	•	Reproduction: Homepage → navigation bar → inconsistent availability of “Marketplace”.
	•	Impact: Undermines the “browse and buy” vision central to monetization.

⸻

Major issues
	1.	Performance
	•	Some pages (Submit Idea, Marketplace) take noticeable seconds to load.
	•	Causes doubt about reliability of underlying system.
	2.	Clarity of value proposition
	•	Hero section explains “AI SaaS Factory,” but does not visually walk a new user through the steps.
	•	Competing sites (e.g., Base44) often show diagrams or workflows.
	3.	Subscription / payment
	•	No visible subscription tiers or clear path to payment.
	•	Without this, prospective users cannot gauge cost or seriousness.

⸻

Minor issues
	•	UI scaling: On smaller screens, hero text and buttons overlap.
	•	Accessibility: No alt-text on major images. Color contrast insufficient in secondary sections.
	•	Consistency: Footer links vary in styling and are missing hover states.

⸻

Visual criticisms & recommendations
	•	Homepage hero
	•	Current: Large bold text + CTA, but lacks supportive imagery.
	•	Recommendation: Add visual storytelling (workflow diagram, animated illustration of “idea → product”).
	•	Forms
	•	Current: Stark, text-only forms.
	•	Recommendation: Use progressive disclosure, labels inside fields, examples like “e.g., AI note-taking app.”
	•	Marketplace cards
	•	Current: Placeholder tiles with limited detail.
	•	Recommendation: Add product imagery, pricing badges, hover states, and filters.
	•	Color palette & contrast
	•	Some muted grays reduce readability.
	•	Recommendation: Increase contrast, especially on CTAs and nav links.

Opportunities for improvement
	1.	Guided onboarding wizard: Walk users step-by-step through account creation, idea submission, and marketplace exploration.
	2.	Live demo or sample product: Let first-time visitors explore an example SaaS app already generated.
	3.	Subscription tiers: Even if early, show “Free / Pro / Enterprise” with clear features.
	4.	Accessibility compliance: Add alt-text, improve contrast, ensure keyboard navigation.
	5.	Performance optimizations: Implement caching, lazy-loading, and compress imagery.

⸻

Positive highlights
	•	Modern aesthetic: Typography and layout are clean, minimal, and professional.
	•	Strong branding: “Forge95” conveys strength, speed, and industrial quality, aligned with the “factory” metaphor.
	•	Clear ambition: Messaging and CTAs reinforce the idea of rapid SaaS creation, consistent with the masterplan.
	•	Future extensibility: Marketplace structure hints at scalable multi-product ecosystem.

⸻

✅ Conclusion: Forge95 already captures attention with its bold vision and clean design, but the usability gaps in navigation, idea submission, and marketplace discovery are severe enough to discourage early adopters. Addressing clarity, visual storytelling, and accessibility will significantly improve trust and conversion.
