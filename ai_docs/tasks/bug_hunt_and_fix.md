3. **Code Quality Issues:** Multiple TODO items and incomplete implementations across development agents
4. **Deprecation Warnings:** Pydantic V2 deprecation warnings that will become errors in V3
5. **Path Resolution Problems:** Tests expecting files in `api-gateway/` but files are actually in `api_gateway/`

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All failing tests are fixed and passing
- [ ] No more logging I/O errors in tenant database operations
- [ ] All critical TODO items are either implemented or properly documented
- [ ] Pydantic deprecation warnings are resolved
- [ ] Test path resolution issues are fixed
- [ ] CI pipeline passes successfully
