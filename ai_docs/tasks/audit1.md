## 3. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
The Forge95 audit revealed several critical user journey issues that are blocking core business functionality:

1. **Account Creation Failures (Critical):** Users experience intermittent HTTP 500 errors during signup and Terms checkbox state instability
2. **Idea Submission Blockers (Critical):** HTTP 422 errors prevent both anonymous and authenticated idea submissions
3. **Session State Inconsistency (Major):** Mixed authentication state across public and app routes after sign-in
4. **Form UX Issues (Minor):** Field value persistence problems and generic error messaging

These issues are preventing users from completing the core "AI SaaS Factory" journey, directly impacting conversion rates and user experience.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Account creation succeeds consistently without HTTP 500 errors
- [ ] Terms checkbox maintains stable state during form submission
- [ ] Idea submission works for both anonymous and authenticated users
- [ ] Session state is universally recognized across all routes
- [ ] Form fields maintain values during navigation and errors
- [ ] Clear, specific error messages replace generic failures
