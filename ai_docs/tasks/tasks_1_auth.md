## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
**Title:** Fix Critical OAuth Authentication Issues - Blank Page After Sign In, User Dashboard, Profile Management, and Production OAuth Configuration

### Goal Statement
**Goal:** Systematically resolve all critical OAuth authentication issues including blank page after sign-in, implement user dashboard functionality, add user profile management, and configure production OAuth settings to ensure seamless user authentication and complete user experience.

### Bug Severity Level
**Severity:** **CRITICAL** - Multiple authentication and user experience blockers preventing core platform functionality

---

## 2. Bug Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture Context
- **Frameworks & Versions:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, React 18, TypeScript 5.8.3, Vite 5
- **Language:** Python (Backend), TypeScript (Frontend)
- **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL 15 + pgvector, asyncpg, custom tenant isolation system
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.4.17, shadcn/ui components, glassmorphism design system with natural olive greens

- **Missing User Dashboard:** No authenticated user interface or dashboard functionality after login
- **No Profile Management:** Users cannot view or edit their account information
- **Development-Only OAuth:** OAuth configured only for development environment, not production-ready

### Affected Components
- **OAuth Authentication Flow:** Post-authentication redirect and session handling
- **User Dashboard System:** Missing authenticated user interface components
- **Profile Management:** User account settings and profile editing functionality
- **Production OAuth Configuration:** OAuth app settings and environment variables

---

## 3. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
The OAuth authentication system has several critical issues that are preventing users from accessing platform functionality after authentication:

1. **Post-Authentication Blank Page (Critical):** Users successfully authenticate via OAuth but are redirected to a blank page instead of the user dashboard
2. **Missing User Dashboard (Critical):** No authenticated user interface exists to display user-specific content and platform features
3. **No Profile Management (Major):** Users cannot access or modify their account information, profile settings, or preferences
4. **Development-Only OAuth (Major):** OAuth system not configured for production deployment, limiting user access to development environment

These issues are preventing authenticated users from accessing core platform functionality, directly impacting user experience and platform adoption.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users are properly redirected to functional dashboard after OAuth authentication
- [ ] Complete user dashboard with authenticated user features implemented
- [ ] User profile management system with account editing capabilities
- [ ] Production OAuth configuration working with proper domain URLs
- [ ] OAuth authentication flow maintains existing tenant isolation and security patterns
- [ ] All authenticated user features work in both development and production environments

---

## 4. Bug Fix Context & Standards

### Bug Fix Standards
- **ðŸš¨ Project Stage:** Production-ready SaaS platform with established multi-agent architecture
- **Breaking Changes:** Must maintain backward compatibility with existing authentication flows and user data
- **Data Handling:** Must preserve existing tenant data and maintain isolation using existing `tenant_db.py` patterns
- **User Base:** Multi-tenant SaaS users with different subscription tiers (starter, pro, growth)
- **Priority:** **CRITICAL** - Authentication and user experience are core platform functionality

---

## 5. Bug Fix Requirements & Standards

### Functional Requirements
- **Post-Authentication Flow:** Fix redirect logic to properly route authenticated users to dashboard
- **User Dashboard Implementation:** Create comprehensive dashboard with user-specific features
- **Profile Management System:** Implement user profile viewing and editing capabilities
- **Production OAuth Setup:** Configure OAuth applications for production deployment
- **Session Management:** Ensure proper session handling and authentication state persistence

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Dashboard load time under 2 seconds, support 1000+ concurrent authenticated users per tenant
- **Security:** Maintain existing security patterns, tenant isolation, input validation, use existing `access_control.py` patterns
- **Usability:** Consistent with existing glassmorphism design, mobile responsive, maintain natural olive green theme
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS breakpoints (320px+, 768px+, 1024px+)
- **Theme Support:** Maintain glassmorphism design system with natural olive greens (green-800 to green-900 gradients)

### Technical Constraints
- [Must use existing tenant isolation system from `tenant_db.py` and `access_control.py`]
- [Cannot modify existing database tables without proper migrations in `dev/migrations/`]
- [Must maintain compatibility with existing agent architecture and orchestration patterns]
- [Must follow existing FastAPI route patterns and Pydantic models from `api_gateway/`]
- [Must use existing glassmorphism design system from `ui/src/index.css`]
- [Must preserve existing authentication patterns and user management workflows]
