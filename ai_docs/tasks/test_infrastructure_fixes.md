## 3. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
The test infrastructure has several critical issues that are preventing reliable testing and development workflow:

1. **Path Resolution Mismatch (Critical):** Tests expect files in `api_gateway/` directory but actual structure uses `api_gateway/`
2. **CI Pipeline Failures (Critical):** Multiple tests failing due to path and configuration issues
3. **Test Environment Inconsistency (Major):** Different test environments have different configurations
4. **Test Discovery Problems (Major):** Tests cannot locate required files and dependencies
5. **Development Workflow Blocking (Major):** Failed tests preventing code merges and deployments

These issues are significantly impacting development velocity and reducing confidence in code quality and system reliability.

### **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**
**Primary Cause:** Inconsistent path naming conventions across the codebase:
- **Documentation inconsistency:** README and docs use `api_gateway/`
- **Scripts inconsistency:** Some scripts expect `api_gateway/`, others use `api_gateway/`
- **Mixed references:** Both patterns exist throughout the codebase
- **Historical naming:** Directory was likely renamed from `api-gateway` to `api_gateway` but references weren't updated

**Contributing Factors:** 
- Lack of centralized path configuration management
- No automated path consistency validation
- Documentation and code got out of sync during development

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests can find required files and dependencies correctly
- [ ] CI pipeline executes successfully without path-related failures
- [ ] Test environment configuration is consistent across all systems
- [ ] Test discovery works reliably in all environments
- [ ] Development workflow is no longer blocked by test failures
- [ ] Test coverage reporting is accurate and reliable
- [ ] **Path consistency established across entire codebase**
- [ ] **Prevention measures implemented to avoid future path issues**
