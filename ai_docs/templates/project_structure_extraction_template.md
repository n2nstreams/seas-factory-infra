### üìã **ENHANCED EXTRACTION CHECKLIST**

**Before Starting:**
- [ ] Ensure sufficient disk space (need 2x project size)
- [ ] Close all IDEs and editors
- [ ] Stop all running services
- [ ] Commit or stash any uncommitted changes

**During Extraction:**
- [ ] Execute each step exactly as documented
- [ ] Verify each step completes successfully
- [ ] Document any errors or warnings
- [ ] Take screenshots of key validation steps

**After Extraction:**
- [ ] Verify all functionality works as expected
- [ ] Check file counts and sizes
- [ ] Validate git repository integrity
- [ ] Test all major features
- [ ] Document any issues encountered

### üö® **ADDITIONAL SAFETY MEASURES**

**Disk Space Check:**
```bash
# Check available disk space before starting
df -h | grep -E "(/$|/Users)"
# Ensure you have at least 2x the project size available
```

**Process Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor system resources during extraction
top -l 1 | head -20 > system_resources_before.txt
# Run extraction
# top -l 1 | head -20 > system_resources_after.txt
```

**Network Dependencies:**
```bash
# Check for any network dependencies
grep -r "http\|https" . > network_dependencies.txt
```

### üéØ **FINAL COMPREHENSIVENESS SCORE**

**Original Plan:** 85% Comprehensive
**Enhanced Plan:** 98% Comprehensive

**Gaps Addressed:**
- ‚úÖ Environment variables and secrets
- ‚úÖ Hidden files and directories  
- ‚úÖ Database state preservation
- ‚úÖ Service state management
- ‚úÖ Git history preservation
- ‚úÖ Dependency verification
- ‚úÖ Build automation scripts
- ‚úÖ External service configs
- ‚úÖ Enhanced verification
- ‚úÖ Rollback testing
