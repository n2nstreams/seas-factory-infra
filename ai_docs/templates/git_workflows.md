- **Description:** Clear, concise description of changes

### Merge Strategy Guidelines
- **Feature Branches:** Use merge commits to preserve history
- **Release Branches:** Use squash merges for clean release history
- **Hotfixes:** Use fast-forward merges when possible
- **Conflict Resolution:** Always resolve conflicts in feature branches, never in main

### CI/CD Integration Best Practices

- **Documentation:** Document resolution steps for team reference

### Branch Synchronization Issues
- **Problem:** Feature branches become out of sync with main
- **Solution:** Regular rebasing or merging from main branch
- **Process:** Rebase feature branch onto main, resolve conflicts, force push if necessary
- **Communication:** Notify team of force pushes and coordinate changes

### CI/CD Pipeline Failures
- **Investigation:** Check logs, identify failing step, reproduce locally
- **Common Causes:** Dependency issues, environment differences, test failures
- **Resolution:** Fix locally, test thoroughly, commit and push fix
- **Prevention:** Use consistent development environments, lock dependency versions

### Team Coordination Challenges
- **Communication:** Regular team sync on workflow changes and procedures
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date workflow documentation
- **Training:** Provide training for new team members on workflow procedures
