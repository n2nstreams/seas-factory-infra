# Phase 3: Configuration Cleanup - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## üéØ **Phase 3 Objectives**
Remove all legacy service references from configuration files, Docker compose, and build scripts to prepare for legacy service deletion.

## ‚úÖ **Completed Tasks**

### **1. Environment Configuration Cleanup**
- **development.env**: Removed `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` and `API_GATEWAY_URL`
- **production.env**: Removed `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` and `API_GATEWAY_URL`  
- **test.env**: Removed `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` and `API_GATEWAY_URL`
- **test_validation.env**: Removed `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` and `API_GATEWAY_URL`

**Before:**
```bash
# Service URLs (Updated for new architecture)
ORCHESTRATOR_URL=http://localhost:8080
API_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
# ... other agent URLs
```

**After:**
```bash
# Service URLs (Updated for new architecture)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
# ... other agent URLs (legacy URLs removed)
```

### **2. Docker Compose Cleanup**
- **dev/docker-compose.yml**: Removed entire `api_gateway` service
  - Removed build context reference to `../api_gateway`
  - Removed container configuration and dependencies
  - Added comment indicating service was decommissioned

**Before:**
```yaml
# Development API Gateway
api_gateway:
  build:
    context: ../api_gateway
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  container_name: saas_factory_api_gateway
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
  # ... full service configuration
```

**After:**
```yaml
# Development API Gateway - REMOVED (service decommissioned)
# api_gateway service removed as part of tech stack transition
```

### **3. Build Script Cleanup**
- **Makefile**: Removed legacy API gateway commands
  - Removed `start-gateway` target
  - Updated `start-all` command to exclude gateway
  - Added comment indicating command was removed

**Before:**
```makefile
start-gateway:
	@echo "üåê Starting API Gateway..."
	cd api_gateway && uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

start-all:
	# ... other services
	@echo "  make start-gateway"
	@echo "  make start-ui"
```

**After:**
```makefile
# start-gateway: REMOVED (API Gateway service decommissioned)

start-all:
	# ... other services
	@echo "  make start-ui"
```

## üîç **Verification Completed**

### **No Remaining Legacy References Found:**
- ‚úÖ **Environment files**: All legacy URLs removed
- ‚úÖ **Docker compose**: No legacy service references
- ‚úÖ **Build scripts**: No legacy commands
- ‚úÖ **Python/JS files**: No legacy imports found
- ‚úÖ **Configuration files**: No legacy references

### **Files Modified:**
1. `config/environments/development.env`
2. `config/environments/production.env`
3. `config/environments/test.env`
4. `config/environments/test_validation.env`
5. `dev/docker-compose.yml`
6. `Makefile`

## üöÄ **Ready for Next Phase**

### **Phase 4: Legacy Service Removal** (READY)
With all configuration references removed, we can now safely:
1. **Delete legacy service directories**:
   - `api_gateway/`
   - `orchestrator/`
   - `dashboard/`
   - `event-relay/`
   - `lang_dummy/`
   - `legacy_archive/`

2. **Remove legacy build artifacts**:
   - Legacy Docker images
   - Legacy Python packages
   - Legacy configuration files

### **Benefits of Configuration Cleanup:**
- ‚úÖ **No broken references** when legacy services are removed
- ‚úÖ **Clean development environment** setup
- ‚úÖ **Simplified deployment** process
- ‚úÖ **Reduced confusion** for developers
- ‚úÖ **Cleaner project structure**

## üìä **Phase 3 Status: 100% COMPLETE** ‚úÖ

**Configuration cleanup is finished!** All legacy service references have been removed from:
- Environment configuration files
- Docker compose files  
- Build scripts and Makefiles
- No broken references remain

**Next step**: Proceed to Phase 4 (Legacy Service Removal) to delete the actual legacy service directories and files.
