Excellent. Here is the complete, updated landing page blueprint, weaving the new business-centric pricing strategy into the "Friendly & Powerful" design with the "Digital Assembly Line" metaphor.

This blueprint now tells a cohesive story, guiding the user from the initial promise of launching a business to understanding the specific operational features that make it possible.

---

### **Final Landing Page Blueprint: The AI SaaS Business Factory**

#### **1. Navigation Menu**

* **Logo:** Clean and modern.
* **Menu Links:** Features, Pricing, FAQ.
* **Call to Action Button:** A high-contrast button with the new focus: `Launch Your Business`.

#### **2. Hero Section: Your Business, Assembled by AI**

This section makes the core value proposition clear from the first second.

* **Visuals:** The **animated "Digital Assembly Line"** remains the centerpiece. A glowing cube ("Idea") enters and is transformed by abstract robotic arms, morphing into wireframes ("Design"), then code ("Code"), and finally resolving into a polished **business dashboard UI** with a small revenue chart, demonstrating a live, running business.
* **Content (Headline & Subheadline):**
    * **Headline:** **Go From Idea to Live Business in Hours.**
    * **Subheadline:** Describe your SaaS idea. Our AI factory builds the app, configures payments, and automates your operations, launching a ready-to-run business on Google Cloud.
* **Call to Action Button:** A large, inviting button that says `Start My Business`.

#### **3. Social Proof Banner**

* This section remains, building immediate trust by showing logos of the powerful technologies used: Google Cloud, Stripe, OpenAI, GitHub. Text: "Built on the world's most trusted platforms."

#### **4. Interactive Demo: "How Your Business Gets Built"**

This section walks the user through the process, continuing the factory metaphor.

* **Station 1: The Blueprint:** A mini-chatbot demo shows how plain language is turned into a structured `requirements.yml` file.
* **Station 2: The Factory Floor:** An animated diagram showcases the AI agents working in sequence: `DesignAgent`, `DevAgent`, `QAAgent`.
* **Station 3: The Showroom:** This now shows the final output—a polished dashboard of the *newly created SaaS product*. It will feature key business metrics: "Live" status, uptime, a sample user count, and a revenue ticker to emphasize that the result is a transactable business.

#### **5. Feature Highlights: More Than Code, A Complete Business System**

This section directly addresses the pain points of launching a business, with a focus on operational value.
