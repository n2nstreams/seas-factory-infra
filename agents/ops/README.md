# Operations Agents

This directory contains the DevOps and AIOps agents for the SaaS Factory platform.

## DevOps Agent (`devops_agent.py`)

The DevOps Agent handles automated deployment and infrastructure management.

### Features (Planned)
- **Deployment Orchestration**: Automated deployment of services across multiple regions
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Dynamic scaling and resource management
- **CI/CD Pipeline Management**: Integration with build and deployment pipelines
- **Environment Management**: Configuration management across environments
- **Rollback Procedures**: Automated rollback capabilities with health checks

### Current Status
- ✅ Basic structure and interfaces defined
- ⏳ Cloud Run deployment integration (TODO)
- ⏳ Health check automation (TODO)
- ⏳ Rollback procedures (TODO)
- ⏳ Monitoring integration (TODO)

### Usage
```python
from agents.ops.devops_agent import DevOpsAgent, DeploymentConfig

config = DeploymentConfig(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    environment="production",
    version="1.0.0"
)

agent = DevOpsAgent(config)
status = agent.deploy_service("api-backend", "1.0.0")
```

## AIOps Agent (`aiops_agent.py`)

The AIOps Agent provides AI-driven operations and monitoring capabilities.

### Features (Planned)
- **Log Analysis**: Pattern recognition and anomaly detection in logs
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics analysis
- **Predictive Scaling**: ML-based resource scaling predictions
- **Incident Response**: Automated incident detection and response
- **Root Cause Analysis**: AI-powered root cause identification

### Current Status
- ✅ Basic structure and interfaces defined
- ⏳ Log analysis implementation (TODO)
- ⏳ Anomaly detection algorithms (TODO)
- ⏳ Performance monitoring integration (TODO)
- ⏳ Incident management workflows (TODO)

### Usage
```python
from agents.ops.aiops_agent import AIOpsAgent

agent = AIOpsAgent("your-project-id")
metrics = agent.monitor_performance("api-backend")
anomalies = agent.detect_anomalies(metrics)
```

## Integration with Infrastructure

Both agents are designed to integrate with the SaaS Factory infrastructure:

- **Cloud Run**: Deploy and manage containerized services
- **Cloud SQL**: Monitor database performance and connectivity
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Integrate with GCP monitoring and alerting
- **Cloud Load Balancing**: Manage traffic distribution
- **Pub/Sub**: Handle event-driven operations and notifications

## Future Enhancements

### DevOps Agent
1. **Blue/Green Deployments**: Implement zero-downtime deployments
2. **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollouts with automatic rollback
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform integration for resource management
4. **Multi-Cloud Support**: AWS and Azure deployment capabilities
5. **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

### AIOps Agent
1. **Machine Learning Models**: Train custom models for anomaly detection
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Cross-service impact analysis
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast resource needs and potential issues
4. **Automated Remediation**: Self-healing infrastructure capabilities
5. **Cost Optimization**: AI-driven cost analysis and optimization

## Configuration

Both agents require configuration through environment variables or configuration files:

```bash
# Required environment variables
export PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export ENVIRONMENT="production"
export MONITORING_ENABLED="true"
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="your-slack-webhook"
```

## Testing

Run tests for the agents:

```bash
# Test DevOps Agent
python agents/ops/devops_agent.py

# Test AIOps Agent
python agents/ops/aiops_agent.py
```

## Contributing

When extending these agents:

1. Follow the existing interface patterns
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Include logging for all operations
4. Write unit tests for new functionality
5. Update this README with new features
