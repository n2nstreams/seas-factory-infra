```

### 2. Cost Analysis

#### Cloud Run Cost Model
```
💰 Pay-per-request + compute time
💰 No charges when not serving requests
💰 Automatic scaling to zero
💰 $0.40 per million requests + compute

Example Monthly Cost (1000 requests/day):
- Requests: 30K × $0.40/1M = $0.01
- CPU: 100ms avg × 0.25 vCPU × $24.00/vCPU-month = $1.80
- Memory: 100ms avg × 512MB × $2.50/GB-month = $0.38
Total: ~$2.19/month
```

#### GKE Autopilot Cost Model
```
💰 Pay for requested pod resources
💰 Minimum billing per pod (even when idle)
💰 Per-second billing with 1-minute minimum
💰 $0.066/vCPU-hour + $0.0071/GB-hour

Example Monthly Cost (same workload):
- CPU: 0.25 vCPU × 24/7 × $0.066 = $11.88
- Memory: 0.5 GB × 24/7 × $0.0071 = $2.56
Total: ~$14.44/month (6.6x more expensive)

Break-even point: ~5,000 requests/day
```

### 3. Scalability & Performance

Performance Characteristics:
  ✅ Excellent for request-response patterns
  ✅ Built-in load balancing
  ✅ No resource waste during low traffic
  ❌ Cold starts can impact latency
  ❌ Limited to HTTP/gRPC traffic
```

#### GKE Autopilot Scaling
```yaml
Pod Scaling Options:
