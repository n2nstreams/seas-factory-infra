## 🔄 NEXT PHASE: Supabase Integration & Verification

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Configure Supabase Connection**
   - Set up Supabase database credentials
   - Test connection to Supabase
   - Verify table structure matches legacy system

2. **Run Full Data Integrity Verification**
   - Execute the same 4 verification checks against Supabase
   - Compare results with legacy baseline
   - Calculate drift percentages
   - Identify any data inconsistencies

3. **Address Migration Issues**
   - Fix any data drift >0.05%
   - Resolve referential integrity issues
   - Ensure 100% data completeness

### Verification Scripts Available
- `scripts/legacy_data_integrity_check.py` - ✅ COMPLETE
- `scripts/data_integrity_verification.py` - 🔄 READY (requires Supabase config)

## 🚀 RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Immediate Action
1. **Set up Supabase environment variables** in `.env` file
2. **Test Supabase connection** using the verification script
3. **Run full verification** once connection is established

### For Team Coordination
1. **Share baseline metrics** with development team
2. **Coordinate Supabase setup** with infrastructure team
3. **Plan migration timeline** based on verification results

### For Risk Mitigation
1. **Backup legacy database** before any migration attempts
2. **Test verification scripts** in staging environment first
3. **Have rollback plan** ready for any data integrity issues
